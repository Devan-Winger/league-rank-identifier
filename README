this is my first project
This was written for google script for use in spreadsheets
takes any League account name and provides full soloq ranked info
in the form of "tier,rank, leaguepoints"
barely understood what I did so im probably no help
IN "apirequest2" YOU NEED TO CHANGE THE LINK TO YOUR OWN RIOT DEVELOPER API CODE
these can be received for free by just making an account at https://developer.riotgames.com/apis
Uses summoner 4 and League 4 api's for information
